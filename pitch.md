Let's start with the facts

The music industry is messy. Everyone knows that. And Very few people would disagree on that Today's music industry is dominated by digital streaming.

And while it has opened the doors for artists to distribute their music like never before, there is still a huge barrier of entry when it comes to music  monetization and rights administration.

This affects independent artists disproportionately, even if they have the talent. Which has a cascading effect on the industry as a whole because it reduces the diversity of music that is discoverable.

According to Spotify’s latest Loud & Clear report shows there are around 12 million creators on the platform, but only 71,200 of them earned over $10,000 last year—about 0.6%. While not everyone is aiming for professional quality, if even 2% of the remaining creators are consistently improving and releasing music, it could introduce a significant wave of diverse, emerging talent to the platform.

Moreover, The MLC, or mechanical licensing collective itself was created in 2019 by the U.S. government  because it recognized that the existing system had completely failed at tracking and paying rights holders.
It has distributed over $223 million in unmatched royalties to date.

Talent isn’t the issue. Infrastructure is.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Matter of fact There is a surplus of talent in the industry, and we believe we can design something around that, and that is exactly what our vision is

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Musika Labs started out as a simple idea "What if we could pay artist for each second their music is consumed? Instantly and transparently"

It was here where we realized the existing infrastructure was not flexible enough for something like this. So, we set out to learn the industry, how money flows, and pinpoint the specific friction points we could use as leverage for our new system

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The result of this is a two-pronged approach.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, the Musika Publishing Company.

This is real-world publishing company in the U.S can represent us within the music industry and act as a source of truth for our future web3 applications. 

Moreover, it allows us to provide real value for artists at launch because in the United States, you must register your music with a publishing entity to receive all of your royalties, 
something most DIY artists often forget. A lot don't even register with collection agencies like ASCAP and the MLC. Most don't even copyright their work and instead rely on the royalties paid to them by their distributors, which are limited.

This puts a hamper on their career early on because they are not capturing the full value of their work, even if it's not much.

By entering the industry as a digital publisher, Musika is not only helping the artist directly by helping them establish ownership but also establishing a working relationship with the artist.

Currently, the Musika Publishing Company is a legally registered entity in the United States, and both a member of ASCAP and the MLC. And our first track, "Texas Bourbon and You" by our cofounder, Kent Hunt, already out on all major streaming platforms.

In the future, we want to grow the publishing company to open opportunities for artists such as booking them shows, sync licensing, merchandise, as well as recording

The Software and Automation Division is the second half of our foundation. 

The Software and Automation Division is the second half of our foundation.

Its function is to streamline operations and leverage Solana to create entirely new markets for our artists. By using the information and performance analytics available to the publishing company, we are able to not only make publishing more efficient, but also create a positive feedback loop — where each success in Web2 fuels the creation of on-chain products, and each success on-chain feeds back into traditional opportunities.

Together, they form a closed loop: real-world trust flows into digital ownership, and digital success strengthens the artist’s presence in Web2.

The first product to be launched by Musika Labs is what we call the "Musika Digital rights Marketplace" or MDRM. 

The MDRM leverages the publisher's ability to create

## Scout

Scout is our autonomous discovery agent, plugged into social feeds and streaming charts. When it detects breakout momentum, it locks the finding with a cryptographic signature—proof we spotted the artist first. 
That signature; minting a Scout NFT, a measurable performance token. If the artist later signs with Musika, the NFT earns a share of publishing royalties.

## ANONOBOND

Our Scout agent has autonomy to mint an NFT that shadows unsigned talent, then with an NFT auction we set a price; to hard-code the yield in $MU, Musika’s token. As creative momentum surges; we release the remaining NFTs and let more believers in. If momentum stalls? The supply freezes and scarcity becomes the headline.

Fast-forward to maturity: claim your $MU tokens and exit, or hold on to the NFT to tap access to a Bitcoin reserve that grows with platform activity. And when the artist inks a deal with Musika Publishing, the token evolves once more, converting into real royalty flow.

One early commitment, three stacking rewards: $MU yield, Bitcoin upside, future royalties.

That’s a dinner-party story you will tell the rest of your life.
